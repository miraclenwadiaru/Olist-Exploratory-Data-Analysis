# Olist-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis using Python

Introduction
A Data Analysis challenge was hosted in April 2023, on the Twitter tech space, and we were asked to analyze and explore the Olist E-commerce dataset pulled from Kaggle. The dataset is designed to help data analysts and researchers better understand the e-commerce landscape in Brazil and to identify growth opportunities. And to help Olist gain better insights into its e-commerce platform and optimize available growth opportunities.

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that connects small and medium-sized businesses to customers across Brazil. The platform operates as a marketplace, where merchants can list their products and services and customers can browse and purchase them online.
 
Dataset Description
The Olist dataset is available on Kaggle and is a collection of anonymized data about orders placed on the Olist platform between January 2016 and August 2018. It contains a wide range of information about each order including the order date, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller ID, and customer reviews.
The tool used: For this challenge, I used Python to carry out exploratory data analysis.
 
Steps
Data Cleaning: merging the datasets, checking for missing values and duplicates
Exploratory Data Analysis: Explored the dataset to gain insights about Olist
Conclusion and Recommendation.

The average order cancelation rate on Olist is 0.62%, which is a bit high and this can have an impact on sales performance negatively.

The product category with the highest profit margin (80%) is home comfort. The lowest is computers. Olist can implement dynamic pricing strategies for low-profit margin products.
 
 
 
Conclusion and Recommendation
From the insights gotten from the data, we can say Olist's marketing spend and channel mix impact sales of some products positively, while some products didn't generate much revenue. However, to optimize its marketing strategy to increase ROI, Olist should consider focusing on Search engine optimization to increase visibility and attract more customers, reducing the cost of customer acquisition. The lower the CCA, the more profitable Olist will be. And Olist focuses more on fast-selling products such as those in computer accessories.
